  - Be careful which types of flowers to choose though... Start by collecting the
    riddle placed right infront of you.
  - The riddle should tell you which 4 flowers to pick, and which 2 to avoid.
  - Pick atleast 3 flowers of each correct flower to make a bouquet. Visit the fountain
    once you are done.
  - There are hints scattered around the garden to help you solve the riddle. Good
    luck!
