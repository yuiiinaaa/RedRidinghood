# Scarlet's Shadow

This is a 4-person final project for DIS Copenhagen: Game Development & Lab. 

"Scarlet's Shadow" is a horror-aesthetic game themed on personal growth, decision-making, and moral good. 
The game is inspired by the fairytale "The Little Red Riding Hood", and like the original tale,
the player's objective is to navigate the forest and safely get to grandma's house with some goods. 

Unknowingly the player is in a dream state, and the narrative of the game focuses on overcoming the inner darkness held within the player. 
The main enemy and the narrator are both internal parts of the player, which the player will piece together clues to find out as the game progresses. 

There are two main outcomes to the story: either the player will be enveloped by darkness (their loss of hope and loneliness, resulting in death) OR
the player will find a way to bring light to the land and wake up from the dream. 


# Instructions: 
WASD or Arrow keys - Move // 
E - interact with object OR hide in bush // 
P - Plant a flower // 
Esc - Exit out of note or lock // 
Enter/Return - continue dialogue // 

# Dialogue and choice system
The player's choices in the game impact the ending. 

# Glow flowers
Glow flowers also serve as a way for the player not to get lost in the map, so the player can replant flowers by pressing “P”.

# Glow orb
The Glow orb in each level must be activated for the player to unlock the good ending.
Glow orb can be activated using 5 glow flowers.

# Diary and Notes system
The player can collect notes and clues throughout the game to help figure out certain puzzles and each level. 
Notes can also give clues about the story.
All of the notes that have been collected can be accessed at the top right corner with the diary icon. 

# Enemy AI
The enemy will roam in some chapters.
If the enemy is nearby, audio hints the player to run away.
Players can hide from the enemy by pressing "E" near a bush.
