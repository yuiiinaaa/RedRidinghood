This is a 4-person final project for DIS Copenhagen: Game Development & Lab. 

"Scarlet's Shadow" is a horror-aesthetic game themed on personal growth, decision-making, and moral good. The game is inspired by the fairytale "The Little Red Riding Hood", and like the original tale,
the player's objective is to navigate the forest and safely get to grandma's house with some goods. 

Unknowingly the player is in a dream state, and the narrative of the game focuses on overcoming the inner darkness held within the player. 
The main enemy and the narrator are both internal parts of the player, which the player will piece together clues to find out as the game progresses. 

There are two main outcomes to the story: either the player will be enveloped by darkness (their loss of hope and loneliness, resulting in death) OR
the player will find a way to bring light to the land and wake up from the dream.
